<p>Here I will talk about my favorite conqueror Temujin also known as Ghengis Khan.
I think he is my favorite because he had the largest empire ever to this day.</p>
It also goes along with another one of my favorite topics: Civilization, it seemed that the great
khan found the people in their walls and cities weaker or inferior. I'm not quite sure why he felt that
way but it was said there was a village that surrendered and was killed by just one single mongol warrior.
It wasnt because he was that much stronger or fiercer but it was because the people were terrified of him
and they did not have the guts to fight back. They were compliant when he told them to tie one another
up and then he slaughtered them.</body>
